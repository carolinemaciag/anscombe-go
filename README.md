# Anscombe's Quartet Regression Analysis

This project uses **Anscombe's Quartet** dataset to perform a linear regression analysis- utilizing both **Go**,and **Python**. The goal is using both languages to compare the results of the linear regression, including the slopes and intercepts for the datasets.

## Overview

This repository includes code that performs linear regression analysis on Anscombe's Quartet datasets. Anscombeâ€™s Quartet contains four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics but very different distributions and appearances. The regression is performed using:

- **Go** for the main application logic.
- **Python** for comparison and additional analysis.

The the following python program example was used in the comparison, with only a few adjustments made to the code: 

miller-mtpa-chapter-1-program.py

The linear regression models calculate the **slope** and **intercept** for each dataset, and execution times are also deployed as a comparison.

## Installation

To install and use the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carolinemaciag/anscombe-go.git
```

### Go Dependencies

For Go, make sure you have Go installed on your system (version 1.16 or above).

- Download Go from the official website: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Python Dependencies

For Python, you will need the following libraries:

- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **statsmodels**

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
```

### Running the Program

To run the program for **Go**, use the following:

```bash
go run main.go
```

For the **Python regression**, it is easiest to run the program in a Jupyter notebook.
